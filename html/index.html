<h1>Similarity</h1>

<p>Experimental tool for finding similar glyphs</p>

<h2>Before you start:</h2>
<p>For this extension to work, you need to install <em>numpy</em> with the <em>Python / Install Python Packages</em> menu. And then type <em>numpy</em> and return.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<img src="similaritywindow.png">

<ul>
	<li>Open a Glyph window, select Similarity from the extensions menu - this window will appear.</li>
	<li>The columns named <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> show the similarity score. You will notice that only values very close to <em>1</em> make sense.</li>
	
	<li>The columns named <em>Category</em> and <em>Range</em> show the Unicode category and Unicode Range name. If selected, the list will only show the glyphs in the same category or range as the current glyph.</li>
	
	<li>Selecting a glyph in the list will draw that glyph in the background of the current glyph. Selected glyphs that matched on the left are drawn in red. Glyphs that matched on the right are drawn in blue.</li>
	
	<li><em>Threshold slider</em> and value: sets a threshold on the similarity score.</li>
	
	<li><em>Zone checkboxes</em>: a rough way to control which vertical zones are included in the comparison. So if "Above xHeight" is checked, differences above the xheight will be noticed.</li>
	<li><em>Double click on a glyph</em> in the list to jump to that glyph in the editor. The Similarity window will refresh and show the similarities with the new glyph.</li>

	<li><em>SpaceCenter button</em> will open a new spaceCenter and show these glyphs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Well, it is an pretty objective way of analysing shapes. So there may be some use for it. Using it myself I notice some results are counter intuititve - but this is because we like to work with glyphs that are clustered along semantic rules. "All the a accents". And those are not the same as the geometric similarities this thing finds.</p>


<img src="profile.png">


<h2>How</h2>

<ul>
<li>This works by calculating a profile for each side of each glyph. The green dots on the image above show a left profile. Calculating these profiles will take a noticable amount of time at first, after that the values are stored and only recalculated when a glyph actually changes.</li>

<li>The profiles are <em>normalized</em>, the average of all values is substracted from each value. So the profiles shift a bit. If there is a bit that stick out, the average will be different and the profile will normalize slightly different from a shape that does not stick out.</li>

<li>Then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a> value, the "similarity score", can be calculated for two corresponding sides in different glyphs. This is pretty quick, thanks to numpy.</li>

<li>You will see that only values very close to <em>1.00</em> still make sense. But you can play with the Threshold slider to discover where all the glyphs are. Note that accents above glyphs can substantially change the profile. So while we may expect <em>/a</em> and <em>/aacute</em> to be very similar, the profiles might be different enough to rank further apart.</li>

<li>So keep in mind the glyphs that this extension finds are not necessarily kerning groups.</li>
